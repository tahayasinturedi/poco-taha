The world translator


Write a function named helloWorld that:
Takes 1 argument, a language code (e.g. "es", "de", "en")
Returns "Hello, World" for the given language, for at least 3 languages. It should default to returning English.
Call that function for each of the supported languages and log the result to make sure it works
