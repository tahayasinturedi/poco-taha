Exercise 1

    -Create a website to show off your new skills. Core HTML tags you should be able to include on your page(s):
    -A nav bar with a few links that either navigate to other pages or act as anchor tags.
    -A heading to signal something important or declare a new section/paragraph.
    -A couple paragraphs describing the amazing things you want to share. Remember to use emphasis on key words!
    -A list of key things to know about something in your paragraph. Why not do an ordered list and unordered list?
    -An image of something relevant.
    -A short contact form
    -A table to display additional contact data
    -A footer at the bottom of the page declaring your copyright on such a wonderful write-up, and make sure you use the copyright symbol!
    -Your page should validate in this at this link: W3 Validator.
Keep your code readabable and maintanable for your future self and future contributors.
